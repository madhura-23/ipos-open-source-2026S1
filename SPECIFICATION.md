## 1. Project Purpose

Build a **Task Management System** that:

- Starts as an existing command‑line (CLI) Python task app
- Is restructured into clear, separate backend parts
- Is made available through:
  - **FastAPI** (REST endpoints)
  - **FastMCP** (tool‑based interface)
- Uses the **Gemini free tier API** through MCP to handle natural‑language input

Every part of the system must follow the **Canonical System Architecture (Section 3)**.

The system must be built so it can be extended later with:

- New data structures
- New algorithms
- Object‑oriented features
- Design patterns
- Tests and automation

---

## 2. Scope

These rules apply everywhere in the project and must follow the architecture in **Section 3**.

### Constraints

- Data is stored in memory only
- No users or authentication
- No frontend or UI
- No logging framework
- No duplicated logic
- No unnecessary complexity

### Core Rule

All decision‑making logic must live in **one place only**: the service layer.

```text
FastAPI Routes → TaskService ← MCP Tools
```

Nothing else may change task data or make task decisions.

---

## 3. Canonical System Architecture

This section defines the **one correct system design**.\
Nothing elsewhere may conflict with it.

---

### Design Rules

- All task logic lives in the Service Layer
- FastAPI and MCP only pass data in and out
- Only the Service Layer can read or write storage
- Gemini is required and can be used **only through MCP**
- Gemini helps interpret requests but never decides outcomes
- No layer may skip another layer

---

### Overall System Flow

---

### Inside the MCP Layer

- MCP tools may call Gemini
- MCP tools must call the service to do anything with tasks

---

### Storage Access

Only the Service Layer is allowed to talk to storage.

---

### Who Can Talk to What

| Layer       | Can use TaskService | Can use Storage | Can use Gemini |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Client      | No                  | No              | No             |
| FastAPI     | Yes                 | No              | No             |
| MCP Tools   | Yes                 | No              | Yes            |
| Gemini API  | No                  | No              | No             |
| TaskService | —                   | Yes             | No             |

## 4. Project Structure

The folder layout matches the architecture above.

```text

│   ├── observers/
│   └── tests/
├── docs/
└── scripts/
```

---

## 5. Data Model

Models only **store data**.\
They do not make decisions.

---

## 6. Data Storage (v1)

### Rules

- Use a list to keep task order
- Use a map for fast lookup by ID
- Storage is shared through a singleton
- Everything is in memory

---

## 7. Service Layer

The Service Layer controls **all task behavior**.

### Required Methods

- `add_task(title)`
- `list_tasks()`
- `delete_task(id)`
- `mark_complete(id)`
- `search_tasks(keyword)`
- `sort_tasks(method="default")`

### Rules

- Only this layer may change tasks
- No FastAPI, MCP, or Gemini logic inside
- Both FastAPI and MCP must reuse it

---

## 8. FastAPI Layer

FastAPI only forwards requests to the service.

It must expose all main task actions.

---

## 9. MCP Layer (Gemini Required)

The MCP layer must include Gemini support.

### Required MCP Tools

- `add_task`
- `list_tasks`
- `delete_task`
- `mark_complete`
- `search_tasks`
- `nl_query_tasks` (uses Gemini)
- `summarize_tasks` (uses Gemini)

---

## 10. Gemini Integration (Required)

Gemini is required in v1 and must follow these rules:

- Used only inside MCP
- Never talks directly to services or storage
- Provides suggestions only
- Output must be structured and checked before use

---

## 11. Extensions

All extensions still follow the same architecture.

### Data Structures

### Algorithms

---

## 12. Design Patterns

Patterns are used to organize code, not replace logic.

---

## 13. Testing

Tests should focus on the service layer.

### Minimum

- Use pytest
- Test at least:
  - `add_task`
  - `list_tasks`

---

## 14. Automation

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
pytest
```

---

## 15. Rectify Bugs

Some errors must still remain in the service layer:

- Wrong list usage
- Broken completion logic
- Bad search assumptions
- Confusing variable names

---

## 16. GitHub Issue Phases

---

## 17. Setup Student Deliverables

The setup student must provide:

- A working FastAPI app
- A correctly isolated service layer
- MCP primitives starting structure
- Initial tests
- GitHub issues & Project board
- Github workflow with Org
  - Coding Standard
  - Issue PR Templates
- A complete README
- Contribution Guidelines

---

## 18. README Requirements

The README must explain:

- The system architecture
- How to run FastAPI
- How to run MCP
- How to configure Gemini
- How to run tests
- Where extensions can be added

---

## 19. Architecture Clarifications

### 19.1 MCP Validation

MCP may only check structure and format.

✅ Allowed:

- JSON shape checks
- Allowed action checks

❌ Not allowed:

- Business logic
- Task state checks

The service layer handles all meaning and rules.

---

### 19.2 FastAPI and MCP Parity

Both FastAPI and MCP must support:

- Create
- List
- Delete
- Complete
- Search

They may look different, but must do the same work internally.

---

### 19.3 Data Structure Rules

Data structures:

✅ May:

- Manage storage mechanics

❌ Must not:

- Contain task rules
- Decide task behavior

All task decisions belong to the Service Layer.

---

## 20. Summary

This specification defines a **clear, strict system design** with:

- One place for all logic
- Required Gemini integration
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Strong support for learning and extension

All implementations must follow **Section 3: Canonical System Architecture**.
